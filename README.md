### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Variables: Variables are placeholder names that usually describe what the variable is used for in code. It starts with the code 'var' followed by the descriptive word. Variables must begin with a letter or underscore. They also cannot include spaces. 
   
Examples of variables are: 

var yellowcircle
                              
var purplesquare

2. Functions: A group of related JavaScript elements that are put together as a single unit. Functions can have names but they also can not have names. Functions without names are called Anonymous and only work where they are placed in the code. Functions are named if someone wants to reuse their code, they are made anonymous if they only want that code in one place.
    
3. Array Object: An array object is a type of variable that stores multiple units. Each object has a number and name. The size (number) is determined by the amount of items placed under it. An array object is also a type of object. An object is a composite data type which contains properties and methods in JavaScript.
